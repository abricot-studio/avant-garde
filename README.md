# Abstractive Art

Abstract generative art with TensorFlow certified ownership on ethereum with nft.
Using neuronal network architecture to output 3 values, defining RGB value for each pixel location.
The Compositional pattern-producing network (CPPN) is composed of dense layers fully connected and activate by tangent hyperbolic.
This network layer kernel bias are initialized with a determinist vector of initialisation derived from your ethereum address.
Each pixel 2d coordinate vector get cross the network and output to rgb values.   
The final image is stored forever on IPFS.
